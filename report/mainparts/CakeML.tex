\chapter{CakeML}

CakeML is a functional language based on a subset of
Standard ML~\cite{CakeML25:online}. It has a
formally verified compiler specified in higher-order logic that passes through
12 intermediate languages and targets machine code for 5 architectures.
%The language includes datatypes, pattern-matching, higher-order functions,
%references, exceptions, polymorphism, and modules and
%signatures~\cite{Kumar:2014:CVI:2535838.2535841}.

The subset of CakeML that has been used for this project mainly
consists of expressions and values. Declarations were excluded as a result of
lack of time. Certain operations were also cut. One of these was bitstring
operators, mostly because of difference in implementation between CakeML
and Haskell, as well as it not being necessary for the proof of concept of
the compiler.
The grammar of expressions is shown in appendix~\ref{app:ASTExp}.

\section{The Compiler}

Following the writing and testing of the lazy semantics, the compiler was
created. The compiler takes CakeML expressions and outputs CakeML expressions,
written with lazy semantics in mind.

The representation of thunks is done using the CakeML expression for
constructors. Expressions are wrapped in constructors with either the name
\textit{Thunk} or \textit{Val}, depending on whether they will produce thunks or
non-thunk values.

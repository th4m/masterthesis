abstract={In 1989 when functional programming was still considered a niche topic, Hughes wrote a visionary paper arguing convincingly 'why functional programming matters'. More than two decades have passed. Has functional programming really mattered? Our answer is a resounding 'Yes!'. Functional programming is now at the forefront of a new generation of programming technologies, and enjoying increasing popularity and influence. In this paper, we review the impact of functional programming, focusing on how it has changed the way we may construct programs, the way we may verify programs, and fundamentally the way we may think about programs.},

abstract={Compilers: Principles, Techniques and Tools, known to professors, students, and developers worldwide as the "Dragon Book," is available in a new edition. Every chapter has been completely revised to reflect developments in software engineering, programming languages, and computer architecture that have occurred since 1986, when the last edition published. The authors, recognizing that few readers will ever go on to construct a compiler, retain their focus on the broader set of problems faced in software design and software development. New chapters include: Chapter 10 Instruction-Level Parallelism Chapter 11 Optimizing for Parallelism and Locality Chapter 12 Interprocedural Analysis},

\chapter{Strict Semantics}
\label{chapter:strict}
As stated in section~\ref{intro:project}, the first major step of this project
was to write lazy semantics for CakeML in Haskell. However, before this could be
done, the existing strict semantics would have to be defined. The definition
would include the basic abstract syntax tree and semantic primitives of the
language.

\section{Implementation}
As CakeML is an already defined language, its underlying semantics already
exists. The compiler for this project is to be written in Haskell, meaning that
the semantics must be defined in Haskell in order for it to be usable. This is
what this section will describe: defining the strict semantics of CakeML in
Haskell.

The semantics of CakeML is defined in LEM, as described in
section~\ref{back:cakeml}. At the beginning of this thesis, a link to CakeML's
GitHub repository was provided, in which the semantics was contained in the form
of \textit{.lem} files. The goal of this part of the thesis was thus to manually
translate the semantics from LEM to Haskell.
